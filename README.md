**Tempus-F** is an open-source and lightweight music client for Subsonic / Navidrome, designed and built natively for Android. It provides a seamless and intuitive music streaming experience, allowing you to access and play your Subsonic music library directly from your Android device. 

Tempus-F does not rely on magic algorithms to decide what you should listen to. Instead, the interface is built around your listening history, randomness, and optionally integrates with services like Listenbrainz.org and Last.fm to personalize your music experience (These must be supported by your backend). 

_The project is a fork of [Tempus](https://github.com/eddyizm/tempus) (Which is a fork of [Tempo](https://github.com/CappielloAntonio/tempo))._

**If you find Tempus-F useful, please consider starring the project on GitHub. It would mean a lot to me and help promote the app to a wider audience.**

**Use the GitHub version of the app for full Android Auto and Chromecast support.**


### Releases  

Please note the two variants in the release assets include release/debug and 32/64 bit flavors.

`Tempus-F-tempus*` <- The github release with all the android auto/chromecast features 

`Tempus-F-degoogled*` <- The izzyOnDroid release that goes without any of the google stuff. Both 32/64bit apk's here on github for those who need a 32bit version.

## Features

## Current Mainly Differences From Tempus

> The current version is functionally aligned with the official Tempus project version 4.9.1.
>
> except these changes:

- Expanded lyrics display area.
- Smooth scrolling of lyrics (while also improving performance).
- Supports displaying lyrics in two lines (with translation).
- Optimized display effects in landscape and split-screen modes.
- Optimized random playback logic.
- Significant optimizations were made to utilize more modern and performant code solutions.

> Further performance optimizations will be carried out.

## Contributing

Please fork and open PR's against the development branch (dev_sffzh). Make sure your PR builds successfully. 

If there is an UI change, please include a before/after screenshot and a short video/gif if that helps elaborating the fix/feature in the PR. 

Currently there are no tests but I would love to start on some unit tests. 

Not a hard requirement but any new feature/change should ideally include an update to the nacent documention.
